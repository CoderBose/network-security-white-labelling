Why do we need a home blood pressure monitor?
Why do we need a home blood pressure monitor?
High blood pressure is now a common condition, especially in the elderly. And more commonly in middle-aged people in recent years.
Elevated blood pressure can lead to many complications, which can lead to strokes, heart attacks or other serious illnesses. Testing blood pressure at home can be an effective way to prevent and check our blood pressure.
The American Heart Association (AHA) and other organisations recommend that anyone with high blood pressure monitor their blood pressure at home. Home monitoring can help you keep track of your blood pressure in a familiar environment and make sure your medications are working. It helps keep track of your treatment.
Disperses the risk of [hidden hypertension]. Blood pressure that is normal when measured in hospital but increases when measured at home, especially at night.
Dispersing [White coat hypertension] (in-office hypertension) means that your blood pressure is elevated when measured in hospital, but normal when measured at home.
This is because of the limited number of measurements and time available at the hospital or clinic. Home monitoring can help you keep track of your blood pressure levels in a familiar environment.
Self-monitoring can reduce the number of times you have to go to the doctor or clinic. Thus reducing your medical costs. This is why you should always have a blood pressure monitor at home.

How To Use AILE Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor
BP monitor use step 1
Wrap the cuff around your left upper arm and bring it in line with your heart.
BP monitor use step 2
Wrap the cuff around the upper arm of the left hand, making sure the cuff is about 0.8-1.2 inches (2-3 cm) above the elbow.
BP monitor use step 3
Keep the slit. Insert a gap of at least two fingers between the cuff and the arm (to prevent excessive pressure on the arm during inflation).
BP monitor use step 4
Sit up straight and relax. Keep the cuff at the same level as your heart and remain quiet (Don't move). Press the ""Start/Stop"" button, the device will automatically inflate to start measurement and wait for the result after 30S.
2 User Mode
The AILE blood pressure machine can record up to 99 independent data from 2 users simultaneously (2*99). Data is automatically recorded after each measurement (with time stamp). It is convenient for you to review your measurements and observe the change of data. More convenient than a manual blood pressure machine.
Common reasons for inaccurate measurements.
1. The cuff is too tight or too loose. When measuring blood pressure, the cuff should be tightened appropriately. Too tight or too loose will have a greater effect on the blood pressure value (it is best to keep 2 fingers free between the cuff and the arm) The cuff is tied 2 to 3 cm above the elbow joint of the arm.
2. Incorrect position of the blood pressure measurement. When measuring blood pressure, the arm should be positioned correctly and the height of the sphygmomanometer, the cuff and the heart should be the same, otherwise the results will be affected.
3. Inadequate self-preparation: being in an emotionally unstable state when measuring blood pressure, or not resting after strenuous exercise, talking while taking blood pressure, etc. will usually result in a high measured blood pressure value; (no food, water or exercise for 30 minutes before the measurement and emotional stability)
Tip: If you are emotionally stable, the blood pressure measured will be more accurate, otherwise high mood swings will interfere with the measurement, no matter what blood pressure monitor is used.
4. Do not compress any blood vessels on your body during the measurement. (including but not limited to stretching your legs, improper measurement position, clenching your fists, bending over, sitting cross-legged or curled up on a sofa or low table) can cause local pressure. Please take measurements in the correct sitting position (please refer to the instructions).
5. Inaccurate measurements can also occur when the electronic blood pressure monitor is low on power (replace the batteries or use the USB cable).
6. One inaccurate measurement does not mean an immediate alarm. Multiple measurements should be taken, each one more than one minute apart.
7. Other cases of inaccuracy : 1 8888750846.
When should I check my blood pressure?
A person's blood pressure varies throughout the day, so it is normal to get different readings at different times and on different days.
The best time to measure your blood pressure is within one hour of waking up in the morning, or before going to bed at night. If measuring in the morning, do so within an hour of waking up, after urinating and before breakfast (or before taking blood pressure medication if you are taking it). If measuring in the evening it is recommended to do so before going to bed. For other times of the day, it is best to measure when your body and mood are stable. It is also recommended that measurements are taken at the same time of day.
Factors such as caffeine, exercise, alcohol, stress levels and the time of day can all affect blood pressure. Try to take your blood pressure at the same time of day. Keep a record of all your blood pressure readings and the time of day. It can be helpful to repeat the blood pressure measurement again in 1-2 minutes and use the average of the 2 readings.
Daily self-monitoring and recording can help you manage your health more appropriately. Having a blood pressure monitor at home can help you reduce your health care costs and reduce the number of frequent hospital visits.
Checking your blood pressure at home is an important part of managing hypertension (High blood pressure).
AILE blood pressure machine is compact and convenient, perfect for home use, travel carry, and office use. Easy to manage your or your family's health, you deserve it!
FAQ
Why was my blood pressure high when I was measured?
There are a variety of factors that can lead to high blood pressure values. Common ones include taking a measurement right after drinking coffee, taking a shower or some physical activity. Being too nervous, moving or talking during the measurement, and not having your arm at the level of your heart can lead to biased measurements.
It is recommended that you stay relaxed and sit quietly at the table while measuring. For other questions you can read the instructions first. If the value of multiple measurements are different, you need to measure two to three times and take the average value. If you have any questions, you can tell us.( We provide 7*24H consultation for AILE Blood Pressure monitor )",AILE,,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/MEDIAX_792452-T1/images/I/61Y6puCWUJL._AC_SX679_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTo4MTUwNzk0OTkyNTA1NzA2OjE3MDIwMTMwNTQ6c3BfYXRmX25leHQ6MzAwMTAxNDc3NjUwNDAyOjowOjo&url=%2FPressure-AILE-pressure-Adjustable-automatic%2Fdp%2FB0BF9YHRFM%2Fref%3Dsr_1_51_sspa%3Fkeywords%3Dsmart%2Bblood%2Bpressure%2Bmonitors%26qid%3D1702013054%26sr%3D8-51-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGZfbmV4dA%26psc%3D1

Will the cuff fit my arm?
Cuff size is dependent upon the circumference of the arm (measured in the center of the bicep). The permissible range is printed on the cuff and our cuffs are a universal size, fitting 8.7 inches - 15.7 inches (22-40 cm) arms. Measure your arm to make sure the cuff will fit you.
How to understand that the device detected an arrhythmia?
If you see three heart symbols on the screen, it indicates that the device has found an arrhythmia, which is a disruption in your heartbeat. This might mean that you need to relax, calm down, and not speak during the measurement. If the symbol appears several times in a single week, we recommend going to a doctor.
Why is there a Micro USB plug on the device?

FAQ
Q1: What are the dangers of high blood pressure?
A1: If hypertension is not effectively controlled over a long period of time, it will cause continuous damage to the heart, brain, kidneys, arteries and other organs, eventually leading to serious complications such as myocardial infarction, cerebral hemorrhage, kidney failure and atherosclerosis, posing a great threat to life and health.
Q2: Why are the blood pressure values measured in the hospital different from those measured at home?
A2: Blood pressure changes throughout the 24 hours and is not fixed. Blood pressure measurements can be affected by a variety of factors such as environment, measurement posture, emotional state, and time of day. Therefore, you should remain relaxed and quiet before taking the measurement.
Q3: Is the result the same if measured on the right arm?
A3: It is ok for both arms, but there will be some different results for different people. It is recommended that you measure the same arm every time.
Q4: When is the best time to measure blood pressure?
A4: Measured in the morning on an empty stomach: when you first get up in the morning, your body is not affected by the outside world and your body is in a stable condition.
Measuring blood pressure at night before going to bed: The body is in a more relaxed state before going to bed.
Measure blood pressure 2-3 hours after taking antihypertensive medication: For patients with hypertension, measuring blood pressure two or three hours after taking medication can reflect whether the medication is effective and how long it lasts.",RENPHO,,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/MEDIAX_792452-T1/images/I/71SNPkF4abL._AC_SX679_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/Pressure-RENPHO-Monitors-Automatic-Christmas/dp/B0B3R4YM9P/ref=sr_1_92?keywords=smart+blood+pressure+monitors&qid=1702013054&sr=8-92

Health science tips - common issues with blood pressure
Hypertension and hypotension are two cardiovascular conditions associated with blood pressure irregularities, and both may pose different health risks.
Dangers of Hypertension:
Increased Cardiovascular Risk: Hypertension places an increased load on the heart, raising the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart enlargement, coronary artery disease, and heart attacks.
Elevated Stroke Risk: Hypertension can lead to cerebrovascular diseases, increasing the risk of conditions like stroke due to its potential to damage blood vessels in the brain.
Kidney Issues: Hypertension may harm kidney function, leading to chronic kidney disease.
Vision Problems: Severe hypertension could cause retinal damage and even result in blindness.
Heart Failure: Prolonged high blood pressure might weaken the heart over time, leading to heart failure.
Dangers of Hypotension:
Fainting and Dizziness: Low blood pressure can result in oxygen deprivation, causing dizziness, fainting, or even unconsciousness.
Cardiac Problems: Low blood pressure may reduce the heart's blood supply, triggering heart attacks or arrhythmias.
Circulation Issues: Hypotension could decrease blood supply to organs, impairing their function.
Weakness and Fatigue: Low blood pressure may lead to feelings of fatigue, weakness, and lethargy.
Orthostatic Hypotension: Rapidly transitioning from lying down or sitting to standing could cause dizziness or fainting due to hypotension.
Whether dealing with hypertension or hypotension, both conditions require proper attention and management. If you suspect blood pressure irregularities, it's crucial to consult a doctor for accurate diagnosis and treatment recommendations.",ZIQING,,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/MEDIAX_792452-T1/images/I/61Q++7ZqqbL._AC_SX679_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/ZIQING-Pressure-Monitor-Premium-Automatic/dp/B0CC191H22/ref=sr_1_95?keywords=smart+blood+pressure+monitors&qid=1702013054&sr=8-95

Why do I need to monitor my blood pressure at home?
Checking your blood pressure at home is an important part of managing high blood pressure (hypertension).
The American Heart Association (AHA) and other organizations recommend that anyone with high blood pressure monitor his or her blood pressure at home. Home monitoring can help you keep tabs on your blood pressure in a familiar setting, make certain your medication is working, and alert you and your doctor to potential health complications.
Monitoring your blood pressure at home can:
Help with early diagnosis. Self-monitoring can help your doctor diagnose high blood pressure earlier than if you have only occasional blood pressure readings in a medical office.
Help track your treatment. The only way to know whether your lifestyle changes or medications are working is to check your blood pressure regularly. Monitoring blood pressure changes at home can help you and your doctor make decisions about your treatment, such as adjusting dosages or changing medications.
Encourage better control. Self-monitoring can give you a stronger sense of responsibility for your health. You may feel even more motivated to control your blood pressure with an improved diet, physical activity and proper medication use.
Cut your health care costs. Self-monitoring might decrease your number of visits to your doctor or clinic.",KONQUEST,,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/MEDIAX_792452-T1/images/I/81idptToRyL._AC_SX679_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/Konquest-KBP-2704A-Automatic-Pressure-Monitor/dp/B077CXGSJW/ref=sr_1_102?keywords=smart+blood+pressure+monitors&qid=1702013054&sr=8-102

Frequently Asked Questions
Why does my blood pressure fluctuate throughout the day?
Individual blood pressure varies multiple times everyday. It is also affected by the way you apply the cuff and your measurement position, so please take the measurement under the same conditions.
If the person takes medicine, the pressure will vary more.
Wait at least 3 minutes for another measurement.
Why do I get a different blood pressure at home compared to the hospital or doctor's office?
The blood pressure is different even throughout the day due to weather, emotion, exercise, etc. Also, there is the 'white coat' effect, which means blood pressure usually increases in clinical settings. Home blood pressure measurement may vary as much as 10-20 points from ones taken at your doctors office.
What you need to pay attention to when you measure your blood pressure at home:
If the cuff is applied properly.
If the cuff is too tight or too loose.
If the cuff is applied on the same arm as previous measurements.
If you feel anxious taking 2-3 deep breaths before beginning will be better for measuring.",Medline,,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/MEDIAX_792452-T1/images/I/81wmv7VTWDL._SX522_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTozOTA1MzM3OTM1MDc0NzA2OjE3MDIwMTMwNTY6c3Bfc2VhcmNoX3RoZW1hdGljOjMwMDA4NzY1MTk2MzMwMjo6NDo6&url=%2FMedline-Automatic-Pressure-Batteries-Professional%2Fdp%2FB01CPPIJ28%2Fref%3Dsxin_15_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa%3Fcontent-id%3Damzn1.sym.d6ad0a4b-2eda-440d-98a3-7289fc1c492e%253Aamzn1.sym.d6ad0a4b-2eda-440d-98a3-7289fc1c492e%26cv_ct_cx%3Dsmart%2Bblood%2Bpressure%2Bmonitors%26keywords%3Dsmart%2Bblood%2Bpressure%2Bmonitors%26pd_rd_i%3DB01CPPIJ28%26pd_rd_r%3Db62564b7-15a1-4b5e-a257-4e782f925117%26pd_rd_w%3D3yJEd%26pd_rd_wg%3DtH8Hb%26pf_rd_p%3Dd6ad0a4b-2eda-440d-98a3-7289fc1c492e%26pf_rd_r%3DHYG0QNFGDNDZP5DEFQA9%26qid%3D1702013056%26sbo%3DRZvfv%252F%252FHxDF%252BO5021pAnSA%253D%253D%26sr%3D1-101-f853d353-bf33-45e7-b5c2-2cb2b31abc9b-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9zZWFyY2hfdGhlbWF0aWM%26psc%3D1

How to properly measure your blood pressure:
Tips
Please keep quiet for 5-10 minutes and avoid eating, drinking alcohol, smoking, exercising and bathing before taking a measurement. All these factors will influence the measurement result.
Remove any garment that fits closely to your upper arm. Always measure on the same arm (normally left).
Measurements should be taken regularly at the same time of each day, as the blood pressure varies even during the day.
Any effort to support the arm during measurement may increase the measured blood pressure.
Make sure, you are in a comfortable, relaxed position and do not move or constrict your muscles during measurement.
Use a cushion to support your arm if necessary. If the arm artery lies lower or higher than the heart, a false reading will be obtained.
A loose or open cuff causes false readings. With repeated measurements , blood accumulates in the arm which can lead to false reading.
Consecutive blood pressure measurements should be repeated after 1 minute pause or after the arm has been held up in order to allow the accumulated blood to flow away",Medisana,,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/MEDIAX_792452-T1/images/I/712xG1BoxQL._SX466_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/Medisana-Upper-Pressure-Monitor-Version/dp/B008KWO3Q2/ref=sr_1_145?keywords=smart+blood+pressure+monitors&qid=1702013056&sr=8-145
