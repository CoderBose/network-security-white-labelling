Treatlife Smart Light Switch
Quick and Easy Setup
Treatlife Smart Switch is a great way to start building your smart home system. It allows you to easily control your lights with your smartphone from anywhere, anytime.
Not only can you save on energy bills and secure your home with custom timers but also control all the lights if you install Treatlife switches throughout your house. You can also experience voice-activated lighting just with your voice through Alexa or Google Assistant.
Treatlife Light Switch comes with labels, the wall plate, and the necessary accessories for your installation.
You can follow the clear direction to complete the wiring and pairing.
It connects to your home's Wi-Fi network. No need for a hub or extra equipment.
What is a neutral wire?
A neutral wire allows our switch to be powered while simultaneously allowing the lighting circuit connected to your lights to be power off.
Do I have neutral wires?
If your house was built in the mid-1980s or later, there is an excellent chance that you have neutrals everywhere in your home.
If there is an outlet (wall receptacle) near the switch, most likely that switch box has a neutral.
Switches that are ganged together have a much higher likelihood of having neutrals, no matter what year.
Checking the switch box
The best way is to check the actual wires in the switch box where you want to install Treatlife.
Please observe all safety precautions before handling the electrical wiring in your switch boxes.
Turn off your breaker box.
Take off the trim plate over the switch.
Remove the screws from your switch and pull out the existing switch to look at the wires.
If you see a white wire (or group of them), it is VERY likely that you have a neutral.
The only way to be absolutely sure that you have found a neutral wire is to check the voltage (110V/120V) between the white wire and the ""hot"" (usually black in color) wire in the box. In a standard switch/dimmer, the ""hot"" is using one of the two wires connected to the switch.

Notice: iOS/iPadOS 16.4 or above or Android 8.1 or above are needed
Thread technology
What is Thread, and why is it important to Matter and the smart home?
Thread is a wireless protocol specifically built for IoT devices. Its designed to make them work faster, have fewer points of failure, use less power, and communicate with each other more seamlessly.
A low-power, low-bandwidth mesh networking protocol that uses the 802.15.4 radio technology, Thread is similar to existing smart home protocols Zigbee and Z-Wave. But unlike them, it doesnt need a central hub or bridge. Instead, Thread devices can talk directly to each other. By cutting out the middle man, Thread can be faster, especially over large networks.
One of benefits of using Thread devices is that you will have fewer devices using your WIFI network. Also, if one device in your Thread network fails, another device will step up and fill in the roles of the failed device. This is the self-healing feature of Thread.

Must Have Neutral Wire
What is a neutral wire?
A neutral wire allows our switch to be powered while simultaneously allowing the lighting circuit connected to your lights to be power off.
Do I have neutral wires?
If your house was built in the mid-1980s or later, there is an excellent chance that you have neutrals everywhere in your home.
If there is an outlet (wall receptacle) near the switch, most likely that switch box has a neutral.
Switches that are ganged together have a much higher likelihood of having neutrals, no matter what year.
Checking the switch box
The best way is to check the actual wires in the switch box where you want to install smart switches.
Please observe all safety precautions before handling the electrical wiring in your switch boxes.
Turn off your breaker box.
Take off the trim plate over the switch.
Remove the screws from your switch and pull out the existing switch to look at the wires.
If you see a white wire (or group of them), it is VERY likely that you have a neutral.
The only way to be absolutely sure that you have found a neutral wire is to check the voltage (110V/120V) between the white wire and the ""hot"" (usually black in color) wire in the box. In a standard switch/dimmer, the ""hot"" is using one of the two wires connected to the switch.",GHome Smart,ALEXA,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/MEDIAX_792452-T2/images/I/41XwL7E-IBL._SY445_SX342_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTo3MzMxNjQxNzU2Nzc2NzA1OjE3MDE5MDk4Njg6c3BfbXRmOjIwMDEwNTY1MzA5ODI5ODo6MDo6&url=%2FSmart-Compatible-Assistant-Single-Pole-Certified%2Fdp%2FB09JZ9594J%2Fref%3Dsr_1_170_sspa%3Fkeywords%3Dsmart%2Bplug%2Bwifi%26qid%3D1701909868%26sr%3D8-170-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9tdGY%26psc%3D1

Notice: iOS/iPadOS 16.4 or above or Android 8.1 or above are needed
Thread technology
What is Thread, and why is it important to Matter and the smart home?
Thread is a wireless protocol specifically built for IoT devices. Its designed to make them work faster, have fewer points of failure, use less power, and communicate with each other more seamlessly.
A low-power, low-bandwidth mesh networking protocol that uses the 802.15.4 radio technology, Thread is similar to existing smart home protocols Zigbee and Z-Wave. But unlike them, it doesnt need a central hub or bridge. Instead, Thread devices can talk directly to each other. By cutting out the middle man, Thread can be faster, especially over large networks.
One of benefits of using Thread devices is that you will have fewer devices using your WIFI network. Also, if one device in your Thread network fails, another device will step up and fill in the roles of the failed device. This is the self-healing feature of Thread.

B08RBSPP4F,YoLink Relay Super Compatible Google,"INTRODUCTION:
Smart relay, can control electrical loads up to 5 amps at 120V (or control larger loads by using this relay to control other relays or contactors with sufficient voltage and current ratings)
The YoLink Relay is a smart, dry contact relay that can be controlled by your iOS and Android devices and by Alexa and Google Assistants, and 3rd-party IoT integration, such as IFTTT. The YoLink Relay can be used to make any non-smart low voltage or high voltage* device or equipment smart. Simply add the YoLink Relay to the YoLink app (YoLink Hub required, not included) and enjoy remote status display and control of your device/equipment, including on/off control, timers and schedules, from anywhere with an internet connection. In addition to voice control using Alexa or Google Assistants, the user-friendly YoLink app provides options for automated control of your devices, appliances, and equipment via automation (e.g. If motion detected, activate 12V DC security siren)
*If the Relay will control loads over 5 amps in current or 120VAC or 30VDC in voltage, a dumb load relay (with coil voltage and contact rang sized accordingly) must be installed. The Relay will control this dumb relay, which will control switching of low or high voltage to your equipment
FEATURES:
One normally-open dry set of contacts for control of electrical circuits or equipment/devices
Control-D2D Device-to-Device pairing allows for some functionality of devices even during the loss of WiFi, internet, and even power (battery-powered devices, only; this device is not battery-powered; requires a UPS or battery backed-up low-voltage power supply, for continued operation in power outages.
BENEFITS:
Works with the convenient and user-friendly YoLink app
Extremely easy and fast installation using the YoLink app with Scan & Play
Ready for manual control, automation (""if this, then that"") and schedules
APPLICATIONS:
YoLinks industry-leading long range communication allows for placing the relay in separate garage buildings, sheds, storage buildings, barns, greenhouses, etc.
Requirements:
YoLink Hub with an internet connection (wired Ethernet or 2.4GHz Wi-Fi). Refer to the Hub user guide for additional information
Smartphone or tablet running iOS 9 or higher, Android 4.4 or higher
Existing or new home appliance or device with wiring ready
DC 5-24V power supply with wiring ready (Power adapter/supply NOT included)
Voltage tester, small slotted screwdriver, wire stripper/cutter or utility knife, or scissors
Double-sided mounting tape (3M brand heavy-duty recommended)
Features:
YoLink is a proprietary wireless technology provided by YoSmart, which is based on Semtech's LoRa wireless technology combined with the YoSmart smart home/building protocol, to provide the most advanced smart home/building devices solution. Compared to WIFI, Bluetooth, ZigBee, Z-Wave, and other smart home protocols, it has the advantages of low-power consumption, long-distance coverage (wall penetration), and anti-interference. It is the first smart building/home protocol that can be very easily set up and is a very low cost but creates a reliable, robust, and more secure IoT network.
YoLink Hub requires a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi connection or a wired connection to your network equipment (patch cord included); We strongly recommend you use a wired connection to the network for a more stable network connection.
Here to Help: We strive to make the YoLink product experience as smooth as possible, and we are working every day to improve it, in our app and in our product documentation.
