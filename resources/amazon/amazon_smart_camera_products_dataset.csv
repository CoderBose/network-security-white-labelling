We recommend using a Vantrue microSD card (ASIN: B07WWCLHGM). Please do not use Sandisk cards and Transend cards.
Please note: This N2S front and cabin dahcam does not support Wi-Fi.
Front & Cabin 2.5K Dual 1440P Dash Cam
The front and cabin camera could record super QHD videos & images front and inside at 2560x1440P with 30fps simultaneously as evidence in case of any accidents. Perfect dual dash camera for Uber, Lyft, Taxi, Cab as well as truck drivers.
Single Front 4K(3840*2160P@25FPS) Recording
Based on the STARVIS IMX335 sensor and advanced F1.4 aperture front lens, the single front dash camera only records roads ahead at up to 4K(3840x2160P@25FPS) to capture license plates.
GPS for Route, Speed Tracking
The N2S dashboard camera comes with an external GPS mount, which helps precisely records your vehicle's location, speed, direction, date, and time to show exactly where and when events occurred, and playback on maps via Vantrue GPS Player. You could also view the speed on the dashcam when driving.
24hrs Front & Inside Parking Mode
Triggered by motion detection or collision detection, the car camera will automatically start recording whenever there is a motion or collision in front of or inside the car. The low bitrate mode enables the dual-lens car camera to record continuously for 24 hours at a low frame rate (720P+720P@15fps) in parking mode, which greatly saves memory space and gives you peace of mind when you leave the car.
This dual channel dash cam requires a hardwire kit(sold separately, ASIN B083XB8T7T) or external battery always connected in parking mode.
Extreme Temperature Resistance
The N2S front and inside dashcam use a super capacitor that can withstand extreme temperatures ranging from 14 to 158F. It could prevent the risks of overheating and ensure the life duration as well as the reliability of the dash camera.
Wide Angle Front & Inside
The 155 angle front-facing camera and 165 angle inside camera simultaneously capture the road front and inside the cabin simultaneously during the day and night. Wide angle of both interior and exterior cameras helps you capture more details in the events.
Advanced WDR Technology
The WDR (Wide Dynamic Range) technology allows the dash camera to perform optimally in any lighting situation by adjusting the exposure to create balanced images and footage, avoid high exposure in strong sunshine and enhance exposure in low-light or backlight situations.
Loop recording & G-Sensor
While the built-in G-sensor detects a crash, the video of the current accident will be locked automatically as well as be saved as an ""event"" video to ensure important files are well protected. The loop recording function will auto overwrite the oldest footage when the memory card reaches its maximum capacity. There is no more need for removing the SD card or formatting and clearing the card. Recommend Vantrue SD card( ASIN: B07WWCLHGM ).
Time Lapse
The Time-lapse feature provides an easy and fun way to record your adventures by compressing hours of driving into minutes of highlights, which greatly saves space for your memory card.",VANTRUE,,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/MEDIAX_792452-T1/images/I/61yJgBtNTQL._AC_SX679_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MToxMDYyNTYzODk3MjA3MDY6MTcwMTk5ODEyMDpzcF9tdGY6MjAwMDM3NDMzMDc2OTcxOjowOjo&url=%2FN2S-Seamless-Recording-G-Sensor-Supported%2Fdp%2FB08CXWDBTY%2Fref%3Dsr_1_108_sspa%3Fkeywords%3Dsmart%2Bcameras%26qid%3D1701998120%26sr%3D8-108-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9tdGY%26psc%3D1

The Outdoor Wireless Camera Allows Family Members Share Real-time Surveillance Video Anywhere Anytime
Q: Do not need any power cord to make the MMQ camera security system work as wireless as you described?
A: wireless  no need power line. The wireless system means that the camera and the video recorder can be connected wirelessly. It does not mean that the product does not need to be connected to any cables. The camera and the video recorder still need to be connected to a power adapter to supply power.
Q:What does Hybrid zoom mean, and what is the difference between it and the zoom of a general camera?
A: 99% of cameras are digital zoom, which will become blurry after zooming in. There are also option zoom cameras, which are very clear after zooming in, but the lens is often stretched and retracted and it is easy to malfunction. We use a dual-lens design to make up for the above 2 The disadvantage of this kind of camera is that it is very clear whether you look far or near, and there is no need to retract the lens, which prolongs the service life of the camera.
Q: The cameras support automatic tracking moving objects?
A: Yes, but this function is turned off by default. You can turn it on if necessary.
Q: A hard disk is already installed in the NVR, do I need to install a memory card in the camera?
A: You dont need to install it, but if you want to be safer, you can choose to install a memory card. In case the NVR is stolen, the cameras memory card still saves video, and multiple saves the video.",MMQ,ESEECLOUD,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/MEDIAX_792452-T1/images/I/71dGyiCik0L._AC_SX466_.jpg,https://www.amazon.com/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTo3MzkzODkzNDI3NDI1NzA2OjE3MDE5OTgxMzY6c3BfbXRmOjMwMDA5NzE0OTM1NDkwMjo6MDo6&url=%2FMMQ-Wireless-Security-Outdoor-Tracking%2Fdp%2FB0CL5X2Y5K%2Fref%3Dsr_1_267_sspa%3Fkeywords%3Dsmart%2Bcameras%26qid%3D1701998136%26sr%3D8-267-spons%26ufe%3Dapp_do%253Aamzn1.fos.17d9e15d-4e43-4581-b373-0e5c1a776d5d%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9tdGY%26psc%3D1
