How do I know if SwitchBot works or not?
Space for the sticker
Space for the sticker requires more than 1cm (0.4 inches), and better to wait 24 hours after being stuck.
When to use add-on
In the case of applying an add-on to a rocker switch, the surface should be clean, flat, and has enough room.
Strong for most
The Bot clicks down with a force strong for most, and still gently for not to break things.
Maximum swing angle
The max swing angle of SwitchBot is 135 degrees. Make sure the Bot is on a surface where the arm could reach the switch or button when pushing down.
