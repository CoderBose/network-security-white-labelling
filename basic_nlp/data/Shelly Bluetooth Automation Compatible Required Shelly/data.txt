USE CASES
Automate the lights and make them follow your schedule

Make any light switch smart with Shelly Plus 1 and control them through your phone or with a voice assistant. Use Shelly App to set automated scenes based on an hour or sunset/sunrise. This way you can set the lights on the porch to switch on around the time you come home from work, or the lights in your hallway to switch off once it is past your family’s bed hour. And don’t worry – light switches can still be used manually to suit the needs of everyone in your home.
