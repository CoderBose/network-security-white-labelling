Thread technology
What is Thread, and why is it important to Matter and the smart home?
Thread is a wireless protocol specifically built for IoT devices. It’s designed to make them work faster, have fewer points of failure, use less power, and communicate with each other more seamlessly.
A low-power, low-bandwidth mesh networking protocol that uses the 802.15.4 radio technology, Thread is similar to existing smart home protocols Zigbee and Z-Wave. But unlike them, it doesn’t need a central hub or bridge. Instead, Thread devices can talk directly to each other. By cutting out the middle man, Thread can be faster, especially over large networks.
One of benefits of using Thread devices is that you will have fewer devices using your WIFI network. Also, if one device in your Thread network fails, another device will step up and fill in the roles of the failed device. This is the self-healing feature of Thread.

Thread technology
What is Thread, and why is it important to Matter and the smart home?
Thread is a wireless protocol specifically built for IoT devices. It’s designed to make them work faster, have fewer points of failure, use less power, and communicate with each other more seamlessly.
A low-power, low-bandwidth mesh networking protocol that uses the 802.15.4 radio technology, Thread is similar to existing smart home protocols Zigbee and Z-Wave. But unlike them, it doesn’t need a central hub or bridge. Instead, Thread devices can talk directly to each other. By cutting out the middle man, Thread can be faster, especially over large networks.
One of benefits of using Thread devices is that you will have fewer devices using your WIFI network. Also, if one device in your Thread network fails, another device will step up and fill in the roles of the failed device. This is the self-healing feature of Thread.
