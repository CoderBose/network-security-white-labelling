Thread technology
What is Thread, and why is it important to Matter and the smart home?
Thread is a wireless protocol specifically built for IoT devices. It’s designed to make them work faster, have fewer points of failure, use less power, and communicate with each other more seamlessly.
A low-power, low-bandwidth mesh networking protocol that uses the 802.15.4 radio technology, Thread is similar to existing smart home protocols Zigbee and Z-Wave. But unlike them, it doesn’t need a central hub or bridge. Instead, Thread devices can talk directly to each other. By cutting out the middle man, Thread can be faster, especially over large networks.
One of benefits of using Thread devices is that you will have fewer devices using your WIFI network. Also, if one device in your Thread network fails, another device will step up and fill in the roles of the failed device. This is the self-healing feature of Thread.

Thread technology
What is Thread, and why is it important to Matter and the smart home?
Thread is a wireless protocol specifically built for IoT devices. It’s designed to make them work faster, have fewer points of failure, use less power, and communicate with each other more seamlessly.
A low-power, low-bandwidth mesh networking protocol that uses the 802.15.4 radio technology, Thread is similar to existing smart home protocols Zigbee and Z-Wave. But unlike them, it doesn’t need a central hub or bridge. Instead, Thread devices can talk directly to each other. By cutting out the middle man, Thread can be faster, especially over large networks.
One of benefits of using Thread devices is that you will have fewer devices using your WIFI network. Also, if one device in your Thread network fails, another device will step up and fill in the roles of the failed device. This is the self-healing feature of Thread.

One day, the 3-year-old daughter told me:
‘Dad, stars in room and garden’.
‘stars at home?’, I was curious. ‘stars tinkle in the sky?’,
‘No, at home’, ‘the lights blink like stars in the garden’,
my 6-year-old son explained what his sister said.
I came to the garden, string lights in the garden weak and flash,
I was frustrated to found that, when dim the lights to higher bright,
no flicker but too bright, when dim down to low bright, flicker.
I thought I should do something, thus I found LEDIMWO,
focus on no flicker led lights and dimmer.
You can adjust brightness of your dimmable lights with Alexa or Google Assistant voice assistants, free your hands and make trivial things easier.
The smart dimmer plug can be controlled far away from the house by Smart Life App via Internet. (Ensure your device is connected to 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi network.)

Q : Dimmer plug can't connect to Wifi router?
A : There are several problems that can affect the Wifi connection:
Whether the Wifi router has turned on the 2.4G mode, because this dimmer plug only supports 2.4G Wifi, not 5G Wifi.
When configuring the network, the distance between the Wifi router and the dimmer plug should be closer.
Whether the dimmer plug has entered the configuration network mode, and whether the red indicator light is flashing. (When the dimmer plug is powered on, quickly press the button on the dimming socket 4 times, wait for a few seconds, the red indicator light will flash twice per second, and the dimmer plug will enter the default configuration network mode.)
Turning on the Bluetooth on the mobile phone will help the SmartLife App quickly find the dimmer plug.

Have a light that needs control from more than two locations? You can pair up to three of the HKRL20 to one HKRL10. The only thing to remember is that the HKRL20 and HKRL60 do not work on their own. The HKRL20 needs an HKRL10 to function. The HKRL60 needs an HKRL50 to function.

At Legrand, we’ve been providing real solutions to real problems for so long, it’s almost second nature. From introducing the world’s first GFCI receptacle in 1971 to ground-breaking SafeLock Protection some 30 years later, we’ve been delivering GFCI innovations designed to enhance safety and ease installation for more than four decades.
Now, we’ve reset the bar on electrical safety again with our latest innovation: the Pass & Seymour Self-Test GFCI Receptacle.
Designed to exceed standard requirements, it’s the only GFCI that tests itself every three seconds—instead of the industry standard three hours—providing a level of reliable electrical protection that’s unprecedented. The device is also designed with a thinner profile to make more room for wires in the wall box. That means it’s not only the safest GFCI receptacle out there but also the easiest to install.

Shown in metallic nickel finish to coordinate with kitchen & bath fixtures and hardware. Other colors available.
Make sure you can spot ground fault trips quickly and resolve them easily with Pass & Seymour GFCI outlets installed in your home as required by the National Electrical Code.
GFCI outlets are part of the new radiant collection, a step up from the standard with simple, classic options in home electrical, home automation controls and screwless wall plates that fit the needs of today's modern homeowner.
