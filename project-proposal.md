**Project Proposal**: Unveiling White-Labeled IoT Devices on E-commerce Platforms(Amazon)

**Objective**:
The objective of this project is to investigate and identify white-labeled IoT devices, specifically smart plugs, available on popular e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and Walmart. By employing web scraping, data analysis, and clustering techniques, we aim to reveal products that may share a common original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or supplier. Once we cover smart plugs, the plan is to then try to do the same for Smart Cameras and Smart blood pressure monitors.

**Research Question**:
Which smart plugs (or other IoT devices) on Amazon or Walmart might be white-labeled, potentially originating from the same OEM?

**Methodology**:
1. Web Scraping: Conduct an extensive web scraping process to collect data on smart plugs from Amazon and Walmart listings.  
2. Data Cleaning and Formatting: Clean and format the scraped data to ensure consistency and prepare it for subsequent analysis.  
3. Data Preparation / Pre-processing: Normalize and preprocess the data, splitting it into relevant categories for further analysis.  
4. Basic NLP to Cluster Similar Text: Utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) to cluster similar product descriptions and texts.  
5. Image Analysis: Apply image analysis techniques to cluster products with similar visuals or user interfaces.  
6. Repeat for Smart Cameras and Smart Blood Pressure Monitors: Modify and apply the established methods to investigate white-labeled products in other IoT categories.  
7. Prepare Presentation for Class: Create a comprehensive presentation summarizing the research, methods, and findings.  
8. Present in Class: Deliver a clear and engaging presentation to the class, sharing insights and potential implications.  

**Skills Required**:
Web scraping  
Basic NLP (utilizing APIs if necessary)  
Image analysis (utilizing APIs if necessary)  
Data analysis and interpretation  
Presentation skills  

**Timeline**:
Step 1: Web Scrape – November 16 - November 20  
Step 2: Data Cleaning and Formatting – November 21 - November 24  
Step 3: Data Preparation / Pre-processing – November 25 - November 28  
Step 4: Basic NLP to Cluster Similar Text – November 29 - December 2  
Step 5: Ability to Do Simple Image Analysis – December 3 - December 6  
Step 6: Repeat for Smart Cameras and Smart Blood Pressure Monitors – December 7 - December 10  
Step 7: Prepare Presentation for Class – December 11 - December 12  
Step 8: Present in Class – December 14  

**Expected Output**:
Clusters of likely white-labeled smart plugs and other IoT devices, indicating potential shared OEMs, along with a presentation summarizing the findings.

**Significance**:
This project aims to shed light on the prevalence of white-labeled products in the IoT market, raising awareness among consumers and encouraging transparency in product labeling.
